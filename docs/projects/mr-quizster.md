In this project, a **student** program is uploaded on the student's @boardname@. The teacher would read out the questions with 2 possible answers ``A`` and ``B``. The student uses the buttons to answer with possible options ``A`` or ``B`` within the time frame. 
The answer is sent with a radio signal to the teacher'd @boardname@ for grading.
At the end of the quiz teacher sends back the result to each student's @boardname@ using @boardname@ serial number.
